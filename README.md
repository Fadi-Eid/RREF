# RREF
Algorithm for computing the reduced row echelon form of a wide matrix in C:
This algorithm was created to compute the reduced row echelon form (RREF) using the C programming language,
this algorithm works on wide matrices only, meaning the number of columns must be greater than the number
of rows to get accurate results. (square matrices are not always well calculated)
The algorithm to compute the RREF requires a lot of arithmetics so it can be inaccurate as well as
ineficient on matrices of large sizes.
Use the RREF software only if the matrix you are working on is medium sized.
This algorithm can be used for finding the inverse of a matrix as well as solving for a system of
linear equations where the number of unknows is the same as the number of equations in the system.
