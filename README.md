## Reduced Row Echelon Form (RREF) Algorithm in C
This project implements an algorithm in C for computing the Reduced Row Echelon Form (RREF) of any matrix. It supports matrices of arbitrary size and structure. The algorithm follows standard row operations (scaling, swapping, and row addition) to transform a given matrix into its RREF.

⚠️ Note: Due to the large number of arithmetic operations involved, the algorithm may suffer from numerical inaccuracies or performance issues when applied to very large matrices.
