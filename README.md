# RREF
Algorithm for computing the reduced row echelon form of a any matrix in C:
This algorithm was created to compute the reduced row echelon form (RREF) using the C programming language,
this algorithm works on all types of matrices.
The algorithm to compute the RREF requires a lot of arithmetics so it can be inaccurate as well as
ineficient on matrices of very large sizes.
